# Microsoft Windows Defender and Firewall


## Introduction

In this project, I review Windows Security Virus and threat protection, update threat definitions, and run Windows Defender Antivirus quick scan. I log onto my virtual machine, and apply some security controls to harden the environmen. The images we will show are:

- Microsoft Defender (Antivirus Software)
- Threat Definitions (Malware characteristics)
- Firewall (Network Security system)
- Endpoint (Remote computing device)

## Exercise 2: Update Threat Definitions

Windows Security uses security intelligence, also known as definitions, to identify known threats. These definitions include information about known threats. These definitions are updated automatically, but if you suspect a problem with your system, you should ensure that threat definitions are up-to-date before you run a scan.


## Step 1
Under Virus & threat protection updates, select Check for updates.

## Step 2
You can view details for the most recent update to your threat definitions. Select Check for updates. This process could take a few minutes. When the update has completed, the Check for updates button will return, and you should notice that the last update time and date have changed. Select the back button to return to the Virus & threat protection screen.

## Exercise 3: Update Threat Definitions

## Step 1
Now we can run an antivirus scan. Click the Quick scan button on the Virus & threat protection screen. The scan will take several minutes to run. When complete, the Quick scan button will reappear. Click Threat history to view any recent findings.

## Step 2
This page shows you the results of the last scan. You see the files identified as a threat and quarantined, so they cannot damage your device. You then see files identified as potential threats but allowed to continue running.

## Conclusion

In this project, Windows Security Virus and threat protection was enabled, threat definitions were updated, and Windows Defender Antivirus quick scan was ran. Microsoft defender was enabled to defend against malicious software programs on the network. Additionally, threat definitions were updated to stay on top of the most curent cybersecurity threats.
